I am Mariann, 30F, interior architect. I move between photography, architecture, and material research. 
The archive reflects that overlap rather than separating it.This is an ongoing photographic archive.

The images are made slowly, on film. 
I’m interested in scale, materiality, and the way attention shifts when an image is encountered up close.

The site is not organised chronologically or thematically in a fixed way.
Images are shuffled, grouped loosely with tags, and meant to be entered at any point.

Clicking through is intentional.
Some images are larger than the screen.
Grain, blur, and partial views are part of the experience.

This is not a portfolio in the traditional sense.
It’s a working collection.

This repository is a personal photography archive and viewing experiment.

Goals:
- Prioritise scale, grain, and material presence of images (especially film).
- Favour interaction patterns that feel exploratory rather than efficient.
- Avoid UI that feels commercial, portfolio-like, or grid-optimised.

Design principles:
- Large images are preferred over dense grids.
- Partial visibility (cropping, zoom, off-screen edges) is intentional.
- Randomisation and reshuffling are features, not bugs.

Interaction rules:
- Clicking through images should feel tactile and rhythmic.
- Scrolling should not be the primary way to consume images.
- Tags are navigational aids, not strict taxonomies.

Code preferences:
- No frameworks.
- Plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
- Readability over clever abstractions.
- Minimal dependencies.

Constraints:
- This site will eventually contain hundreds of images.
- Performance and cognitive load matter more than visual density.
- Solutions should scale without becoming complex to maintain.

Tone:
- Minimal, calm, non-explanatory.
- Avoid instructional UI text unless absolutely necessary.

If unsure, prioritise restraint over features.
